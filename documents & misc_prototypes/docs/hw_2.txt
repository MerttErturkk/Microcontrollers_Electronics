Determine the final value and so the direction of Port 1pins after compact command groups:

( Hint: P1DIR |= A is the compact form of P1DIR = P1DIR | A )

1) ..

P1DIR = 0x04;

P1DIR |=0x01;

2).. (This a new start, forget the previous values)

P1DIR = 0x81;

P1DIR = 0x40 | 0x08;

3).. (This a new start, forget the previous values)

P1DIR = 0x80;

P1DIR |= 0x80;

4).. (This a new start, forget the previous values)

P1DIR = 0xFF;

P1DIR &= 0x80;

5).. (This a new start, forget the previous values)

P1DIR = 0xFF;

P1DIR &= ~0x80;

6).. (This a new start, forget the previous values)

P1DIR = 0xFF;

P1DIR ^= 0x41;

7).. (This a new start, forget the previous values)

P1DIR = 0x00;

P1DIR ^= ~0x77;

Coding:

      Using the example project code "Blink", create a new project named "Homework2" and script such that:
     - Red and Green LEDs on the Lauchpad will blink in alternating orders. That is, RED LED should be ON if GREEN LED is OFF and vice versa.
     - Each LED should be ON for 5K (5.000) cycles.
     Hint: You can still use XOR operation. Now we will have a new mask.
