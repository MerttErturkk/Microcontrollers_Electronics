Calculate the binary representations of numbers by hand:
0x1A
196
23.125 (UQ5.3) ( 8 bits in total, 5 bits for integer, 3 bits for fractional part)
12.130 (UQ4.4)
     2. Calculate the value of resulting variable in each script group (Refer to final slides of Week 2):

x = 0x22;
x = x >> 3;
y = 0x01;
z = 0x44;
z |= y;
X = 0x00FF;
Y = 0x6234;
Y &= ~X;
Y = Y >> 8 ;
