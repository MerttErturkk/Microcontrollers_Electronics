1) Similar to experiment codes, now we want to control toggling of red and green leds using on board button connected to P1.3.

The specs is as follows:

- When no button is pressed, only RED led should toggle whereas GREEN led is off

- When button is pressed, only GREEN led should toggle whereas RED led is off

Toggling delay should be 20K cycles as in the experiment.

2) (You need an additional push button for this experiment)

- There should be push buttons connected to P1.3 (on board) and P1.4 (additional)

- Additional push-button pins should be connected to GND and P1.4.

- When P1.3 is pressed, only RED led should toggle, whereas GREEN led should be off

- When P1.4 is pressed, only GREEN led should toggle, whereas RED led should be off
